# fastapi-starter

## Purpose
This project is meant to give me some opportunity to brush up on my backend development by setting up a quick and simple backend server and an API I can call to ensure it is working properly.

## Setup

### 1) Create and activate virtual environment

(Git Bash)
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/Scripts/activate
```

### 2) Install dependencies


If this is the first time setting up:

```bash
pip install fastapi uvicorn
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

Otherwise, after `requirements.txt` exists: 

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
